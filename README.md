# COVID-19 College Case Dashboard

Want to see how your MA school’s covid-19 statistics fare in comparison to other MA schools? Welcome to our dynamic COVID-19 Dashboard!

The site requires that you register for an account to log into before viewing the dashboard. To register, simply visit the Register tab on the navigation bar. Registration prompts users for a username, password, confirmation of the password, and school. If the username you pick has already been taken, the site will notify you of this, and require that you choose a new username. If the confirmation password does not match your first inputted password, you will also be required to re-try the confirmation. Finally, if you do not choose a college, the site will require that you do so to register.

Once registered, the site will redirect you to the login page. Here, you can use that registration information to log in, typing the correct username, password, and corresponding school. If username, password, or school is incorrect, the site will not allow you to login, and you will be asked to re-try.

Finally after logging-in, you will reach the dashboard! The dashboard displays a county map of Massachusetts and a sliding bar that overlays a zoomed-in map of Massachusetts displaying the locations of the schools who’s data is displayed in the dashboard and on the website. Clicking and dragging the sliding button/bar allows you to compare the two images. Below the images displays a “leaderboard” for colleges and towns. The colleges and towns are ranked by COVID-19 positivity rate based on the past 7 days, and the board is dynamic as it can change after user-inputted data. 

Along the navigation bar lies a series of links to pages containing a more comprehensive overview of the COVID-19 statistics for a respective school. Clicking through the links brings you the data for each school from the past 7 days, as well as since the beginning of the school year. The vaccination rate and town positivity rate corresponding to each school is also displayed. 

Finally, users can input data through visiting the Input tab. Here, a user is prompted to select that they have either tested positive or negative. Once submitted, the input submission will be reflected in the updated covid dashboard for the respective school under which the user is logged into. For example, if a user were logged in through Harvard and tested positive, the Harvard positive case number and testing number would each increase by 1. If significant enough, this will also be reflected in the positivity percentage displayed on the dashboard page.
